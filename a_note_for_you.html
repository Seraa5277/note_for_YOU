      <h1>Hey my love ❤️</h1>
      <p>
        After I broke up with lalit, I was in pieces. I was shattered and I literally don't remember much. It's like my brain just washed the tantrums, the pain. I don't visually remember it, but I still know how it felt. How painful it was, I lost hope, I felt and I did lose myself. There is a lot of differences in me now. I do not know if all of them are healthy or not. But there was you. I remember, you were there. You held when I was break down. You held all the pieces of me in your arms, you told me I'm alright. You became my hope, you became my reason to live, in this cruel, pathetic world. You became the reason of my existence. I was scared, I was feeling lost when WE became a thing. I was scared what if I break down even worse. I had restless nights. No sleep in my eyes, I was still hurting. But you held me, you didn't say much but you held me. No matter how much I resisted, you held me. You always did. 
And I cannot describe how grateful  I am, to have you. You know, when I'm helpless and I'm really tired, when I cannot fight back. I cry, I cry like someone tore my heart out. And cry for help, I literally cry for someone to help me out of this. It was you always, I cried for you to help me. Although I knew, you're really far away rn, you can't help me. But it was always you, it was meat to be YOU. 
You, made me ME, again... 
Better than I ever was, I feel loved, I feel safe, I feel seen, I feel I found ME. And I'm grateful. 
Now, I know how it feels to be in love, I know the warmth of love now. 
I love you. 💓
